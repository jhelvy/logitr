logitr: Fast Estimation of Multinomial (MNL) and Mixed Logit (MXL)
Models with Preference Space and Willingness to Pay Space [Utility
Parameterizations](https://jhelvy.github.io/logitr/articles/utility_models.html)

The latest version includes support for:

- Multinomial logit (MNL) models
- Mixed logit (MXL) models with normal and log-normal parameter
  distributions.
- Preference space and WTP space utility parameterizations.
- Weighted models to differentially weight individual observations.
- Uncorrelated or correlated heterogeneity covariances for mixed logit
  models.
- Functions for computing WTP from preference space models.
- Functions for predicting expected probabilities and outcomes for sets
  of alternatives based on an estimated model.
- A parallelized multistart optimization loop that uses different random
  starting points in each iteration to search for different local minima
  (useful for non-convex problems like MXL models or models with WTP
  space parameterizations).

Mixed logit models are estimated using maximum simulated likelihood
based on the algorithms in Kenneth Trainâ€™s book [*Discrete Choice
Methods with Simulation, 2nd Edition (New York: Cambridge University
Press, 2009)*](https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html).
