logitr: Fast Estimation of Multinomial (MNL) and Mixed Logit (MXL) Models with Preference Space and Willingness to Pay Space [Utility Parameterizations](https://jhelvy.github.io/logitr/articles/utility_models.html)

The latest version includes support for:

- Homogeneous multinomial logit (MNL) models
- Heterogeneous mixed logit (MXL) models with normal and log-normal parameter distributions.
- Preference space and WTP space utility parameterizations.
- Weighted models to differentially weight individual observations.
- Functions for computing WTP from preference space models.
- Functions for predicting expected probabilities and outcomes for sets of alternatives based on an estimated model.
- An optional parallelized multistart optimization loop that uses different random starting points in each iteration to search for different local minima (useful for non-convex problems like MXL models or models with WTP space parameterizations).

Note: MXL models assume uncorrelated heterogeneity covariances and are estimated using maximum simulated likelihood based on the algorithms in Kenneth Train's book [*Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation, 2nd Edition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009)*](https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html).
