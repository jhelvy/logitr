# The main function for estimating logit models

Use this function to estimate multinomial (MNL) and mixed logit (MXL)
models with "Preference" space or "Willingness-to-pay" (WTP) space
utility parameterizations. The function includes an option to run a
multistart optimization loop with random starting points in each
iteration, which is useful for non-convex problems like MXL models or
models with WTP space utility parameterizations. The main optimization
loop uses the `nloptr()` function to minimize the negative
log-likelihood function.

## Arguments

- data:

  The data, formatted as a `data.frame` object.

- outcome:

  The name of the column that identifies the outcome variable, which
  should be coded with a `1` for `TRUE` and `0` for `FALSE`.

- obsID:

  The name of the column that identifies each observation.

- pars:

  The names of the parameters to be estimated in the model. Must be the
  same as the column names in the `data` argument. For WTP space models,
  do not include the `scalePar` variable in `pars`.

- scalePar:

  The name of the column that identifies the scale variable, which is
  typically "price" for WTP space models, but could be any continuous
  variable, such as "time". Defaults to `NULL`.

- randPars:

  A named vector whose names are the random parameters and values the
  distribution: `'n'` for normal, `'ln'` for log-normal, or `'cn'` for
  zero-censored normal. Defaults to `NULL`.

- randScale:

  The random distribution for the scale parameter: `'n'` for normal,
  `'ln'` for log-normal, or `'cn'` for zero-censored normal. Only used
  for WTP space MXL models. Defaults to `NULL`.

- modelSpace:

  This argument is no longer needed as of v0.7.0. The model space is now
  determined based on the `scalePar` argument: if `NULL` (the default),
  the model will be in the preference space, otherwise it will be in the
  WTP space. Defaults to `NULL`.

- weights:

  The name of the column that identifies the weights to be used in model
  estimation. Defaults to `NULL`.

- panelID:

  The name of the column that identifies the individual (for panel data
  where multiple observations are recorded for each individual).
  Defaults to `NULL`.

- clusterID:

  The name of the column that identifies the cluster groups to be used
  in model estimation. Defaults to `NULL`.

- robust:

  Determines whether or not a robust covariance matrix is estimated.
  Defaults to `FALSE`. Specification of a `clusterID` or `weights` will
  override the user setting and set this to \`TRUE' (a warning will be
  displayed in this case). Replicates the functionality of Stata's
  cmcmmixlogit.

- correlation:

  Set to `TRUE` to account for correlation across random parameters
  (correlated heterogeneity). Defaults to `FALSE`.

- startValBounds:

  sets the `lower` and `upper` bounds for the starting parameter values
  for each optimization run, which are generated by
  `runif(n, lower, upper)`. Defaults to `c(-1, 1)`.

- startVals:

  is vector of values to be used as starting values for the
  optimization. Only used for the first run if `numMultiStarts > 1`.
  Defaults to `NULL`.

- numMultiStarts:

  is the number of times to run the optimization loop, each time
  starting from a different random starting point for each parameter
  between `startValBounds`. Recommended for non-convex models, such as
  WTP space models and mixed logit models. Defaults to `1`.

- useAnalyticGrad:

  Set to `FALSE` to use numerically approximated gradients instead of
  analytic gradients during estimation. For now, using the analytic
  gradient is faster for MNL models but slower for MXL models. Defaults
  to `TRUE`.

- scaleInputs:

  By default each variable in `data` is scaled to be between 0 and 1
  before running the optimization routine because it usually helps with
  stability, especially if some of the variables have very large or very
  small values (e.g. `> 10^3` or `< 10^-3`). Set to `FALSE` to turn this
  feature off. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- standardDraws:

  By default, a new set of standard normal draws are generated during
  each call to `logitr` (the same draws are used during each multistart
  iteration). The user can override those draws by providing a matrix of
  standard normal draws if desired. Defaults to `NULL`.

- drawType:

  Specify the draw type as a character: `"halton"` (the default) or
  `"sobol"` (recommended for models with more than 5 random parameters).

- numDraws:

  The number of Halton draws to use for MXL models for the maximum
  simulated likelihood. Defaults to `50`.

- numCores:

  The number of cores to use for parallel processing of the multistart.
  Set to `1` to serially run the multistart. Defaults to `NULL`, in
  which case the number of cores is set to
  `parallel::detectCores() - 1`. Max cores allowed is capped at
  [`parallel::detectCores()`](https://rdrr.io/r/parallel/detectCores.html).

- vcov:

  Set to `TRUE` to evaluate and include the variance-covariance matrix
  and coefficient standard errors in the returned object. Defaults to
  `FALSE`.

- predict:

  If `FALSE`, predicted probabilities, fitted values, and residuals are
  not included in the returned object. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- options:

  A list of options for controlling the `nloptr()` optimization. Run
  [`nloptr::nloptr.print.options()`](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/reference/nloptr.print.options.html)
  for details.
